## Testing Notes 

- nominal configuration on Roy base results in EMI hub reset error
- seems to be board dependent or Kinect dependent 
- Solution: attempt to use PS3
    - backup solution: attemp to setup XU4


## Going forward

- use PS3 camera for RGB image, set up node to publish Theora images over network,
as well as using for the robber detection code
- libuvc for PS3 camera, has ROS package to wrap  
- PS3 is also only USB powered

- if the PS3 camera doesn't work, attempt to set up the XU4
- this might be able to solve the problem, in the way that the XU4
will be able to handle the draw of the Kinect

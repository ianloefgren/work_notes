# Meeting Notes
# 09-28-2017

## What's Next
- Power source test to see how much current Deckard's Odroid is drawing
- Testing for connection using all different battery packs, to characterize batteries



## Newbies
- Twist messages being published, no movement
- Lots of connection drops, made it difficult to work
- Teleop wasn't working when the vicon sys and nav launch files were launched
- Jeremy saves the day!
    - when running vicon nav, namespace is set, turtlebot teleop doesn't have this namespace
    - add it!

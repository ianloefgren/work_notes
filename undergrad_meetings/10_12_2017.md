## Testing

- power supply training complete
    - Constant Current (CC) mode, and max the current limit
    - This prevents the device from being current or voltage starved

- Tested draw of D, R, P
    - D dies with D eMMC at about 1.2A trying to run 4th yes process
    - R dies with R eMMC at about 1.1A trying to run 4th yes process
    - P **does not** die running new Ubuntu 16.04 image, 4 yes processes, ethernet jack 1.3-1.4A
    - D **does not** die running new Ubuntu 16.04 image, 4 yes processes, ethernet jack 1.3-1.4A
    - P **does** die running old Deckard Ubuntu 14.04 image, at 4th yes process, about 1.2A

## Next Steps

- test previously described configurations with nominal peripheral configuration
    - Kinect
    - Serial
    - Wifi dongle

- test above configuration but on battery packs

- Robots seem almost good to go!

- Next Week:
    - All 4 robots moving
- 2 weeks:
    - CnR 1.6 DEMO!

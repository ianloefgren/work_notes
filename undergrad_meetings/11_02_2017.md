# Weekly Notes
# 11-2-2017

## What's been done this week

- fixed Deckard's slow movement
    - wasn't the max velocity, but instead the max acceleration
    - increased from 1 to 2 (presumably m/s^2)

- with Steve's help, got wifi working -> LT has anonymous image prepared
    - needs to be put on one robot still

- video issue from test last week
    - two nodes for image processing with same name caused older node to shut itself down
    - no issues in interface code

## Up next 

- make new robot with anon image using LT's documentation
    - fill in holes as we go

- write launch file for Image_pub.py
    - copy launch file from version 2.0

- tweak caught script parameters due to focal length parameters
    - use LT's calibration function

- talk to Luke about new project: on Tuesday -> report next week

- upgrade robot status tracking -> add post-it details

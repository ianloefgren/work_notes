# Testing / Weekly Notes
# 11-16-2017

## What's been done 

- implemented two difference measures
    - Kullbeck-Leibler Divergence
    - Jensen-Shannon Divergence

- some minor debugging 
    - current issue with gaussian mixture somehow being mutated into a int

## What's next

- more difference measures coded
- begin work on large scale testing setup and data storage

## CnR

- can't run two robots at same time running 1.6
    - one robot - robber of cop and robber - doesn't get instantiated with goal planner

- uvc camera node can't find /dev/video0 Playstation Eye
    - not a permissions issue -> udev rule for permissions added and problem not solved
    - potentially an issue with the camera not being assigned to /dev/video0, and instead some other device

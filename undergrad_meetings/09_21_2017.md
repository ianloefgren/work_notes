# Weekly Notes
# 09-21-2017

## Tuesday

- canTransform timeouts prevented from running experiments. The robot to be run was Roy.

## Thursday

- powered usb hub 
- experiments run, CnR2 7x times, CnR1.6 2x
- experiments ran okay. Deckard was moving slow


## Going forward

- switch deckard image to another robot to try to run experiment
    - wifi dongles need to be switched to get connectivity
    - don't need network connection to run Kinect
    - need to see if Deckard's OS can connect to a Kinect that is powered from a different base
        - 1. if Kinect is not recognized, then it is an OS issue
        - 2. if Kinect is recognized, then it is a Deckard environment issue (base power, or Odroid)



## Cool hardware (good for projects)

drotek tiny rtk gps
localino indoor positioning system (10 cm accuracy, need multiple)

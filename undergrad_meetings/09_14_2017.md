# Weekly Notes 09-14-2017

### Testing Notes:

- Hub shutdown working theory:
    - when CPU was under high load, it would shut down the USB hub as it needed
    that power to run the CPU
    - original testing resutling in crash during stress testing when odroid was
    using battery power, no crash when using usb hub
    - additional testing cannot be made to crash the odroid

- Odroid batteries:
    - batteries have two ports
    - one port can output **2.1A**, one can output **1.5A**

- Deckard unable to connect to Kinect -> also doesn't work on other robots

- Haven't thought about using the OTG port in a while
    - weren't able to get the OTG port to run at any more than 12M even when
    conneted to a high speed device

### Going forward:

- Stress test and run experiment using all wall power -> and powered hub to use 
for powering Odroid.

### New undergrads:

- split into UI for commmands and interfacing
- Sushil on under the hood, Jameson on UI

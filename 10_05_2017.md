## Testing

- attempting power supply test
    - Odroid would not stay alive for more than a moment
     - further training from Steve required
     - something about the constant current limit being turned all the way up? Stay tuned...

- LT currently making a step by step guide for making a new image
    - issues flashing new images onto eMMC chips
    - According to Steve, Uboot is looking in the wrong partition for Linux when trying to boot
    - probably best to just move back to using Ubuntu 14 as the benefits of 16 seem slim
        - Is using Kinetic important going forward? (seems unlikely...)
        - LT couldn't find an image on Hardkernel's website

## Newbies

- demo
    - video with keyboard teleop! 

- up next:
    - hard coded waypoints using nav stack
    - empty costmap


## Upcoming

- power supply training
- actually do the power draw test
- test all battery characteristics

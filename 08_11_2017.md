# Weekly Notes
# August 11th 2017

## TODO:

- Fix Roy's networking -> connect via ethernet or wifi - DONE
- Assign IPs in router by MAC address for robots wifi dongles and ethernet chips - DONE
- Cleanup of tower install branch of CnR2 - DONE
- Documentation!!!!
	- in-code documentation
	- CnR2 wiki updated - DONE
- validate Theora improving performance
- validate Python-generated occupancy grids working, incl. yaml file
- Find solution to Zhora's eth0 MAC address changing after every boot


### What's been done:

- IPs assigned by MAC address for pris, deckard, and roy wifi
- Cleaned up and merged tower_install branch of CnR2
- IPs assigned by MAC address for pris, deckard, roy ethernet
	- MAC addresses modified in /etc/network/interfaces
	- 192.168.20.151 - 154 block
- Improved documentation on CnR2 wiki, including installing, and running experiements


### Need help with:

- ethernet interface eth0 MAC addresses are the same for dekcard, roy, and pris - KINDA DONE
	- just change MAC addresses to be unique? what are the unintended consequences of this
	- From Steve:
		> Ian, the way this is normally done is by having a small EEPROM 	slaved
		to the Ethernet device that contains configuration data, including a
		MAC address. However, the odroid doesn't have one of these, instead
		relying on the chip defaults. You're going to have to do something to
		uniqueify each board, the question is where. Ideally, you can set it
		in the boot.ini file that controls uboot - then, the linux distros can
		be vanilla. Otherwise, you can do it through shell scripts once Linux
		boots.

		> Check out https://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/UBootEnvVariables - this is
		the uboot answer. Try setting ethaddr and see what happens...

	- new MAC addresess were assigned by adding a hwaddress parameter in /etc/network/interfaces with a new address

- Zhora's eth0 MAC address changes after startup every time


## Testing notes:

- First test: both robots using wifi
	- Deckard ping:
		> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 5.988/38.158/90.305/17.339 ms
	- Roy ping:
		> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 4.155/18.413/120.096/22.270 ms

	- Deckard throughput:

	- Roy throughput:
		> [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
		[  3]  0.0-10.1 sec  31.0 MBytes  25.7 Mbits/sec

- Navigation Stack issue, potential reason why robots wouldn't move at all during original failed demo
	- everything is happening correctly until velocity commands are published to a topic to which the turtlebot node is subscribed




### Meeting notes:


### What's next:
- Finish gathering data
- Find and fix disconnect in Nav Stack
- Validate Theora
